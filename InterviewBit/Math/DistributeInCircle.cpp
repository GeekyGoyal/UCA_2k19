/* Solution Approach: We check if the number of items to be distributed is greater than our remaining positions in current cycle of circle or not.
*
* If yes, then we simply return A + C â€“ 1 (We distribute items in same cycle starting from C). Else we compute number of remaining items after completing current cycle and 
* return mod of remaining items.
